# Data
The dataset is describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. It contains 1460 observations with 79 variables, including a house ID and the sale price of each house. The original dataset can be found as train.csv and a description of each variable in the data set is provided in the Data Description.txt file on the github site.

# Modeling
In this competition, I built a predictive regression model to predict housing price in Ames, Iowa. This model will be helpful for price negotiation and adjusting price strategies in the real estate market.

In particular, I implemented advanced regression models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net and XGBoost) from data extracting, preprocessing, feature engineering to modeling and optimized performance with ensemble methods (stacking and blending), finally achieved 0.102 RMSE.
